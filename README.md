### BITS Utility Library
Various utilities. This is primarily a personal toolkit that many other projects depend on.

There's a lot of overlap between this library and Google Guava, including a lot of the classnames, unfortunately. E
don't have any current plans to switch to Guava.

This library contains:
- a bunch of static convenience methods
- some reflection utilities
- a reference counting package
- an sync/async event bus
- very basic tools for dealing with runtime platform

### Build:
$ ant


### Runtime:
After build, add all jars in **lib** and **target** directories to your project.


### Dependencies:
None.
